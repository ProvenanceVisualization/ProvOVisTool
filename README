The research page is created in order to present our comprehensive data visualization research and to introduce our open-source data visualization prototype including studied visualization approaches under a PhD study in Yildiz Technical University to meet the visualization needs such as:

Graph Comparison
Graph Summarization
Backward and Forward Provenance Dependency
Real Time Visualization

based on  W3C PROV-O Ontology Model and to facilitate a comprehensive user study to validate proposed visualization approaches.
